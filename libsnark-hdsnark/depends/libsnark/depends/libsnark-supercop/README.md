This folder contains a selection of implementation files
taken from the Supercop framework to support the ADSNARK
example. 

Supercop permits automatically detecting the best
compilation options for each of these algorithms in any
given platform. 

For optimal performance, Supercop should be used to 
determine  the compilation options for each specific file 
in the target machine. 

If the ADSNARK example fails to build out of the box, 
then it may be a good idea to execute ./do in this folder 
before trying anything else.

Supercop is available from:
